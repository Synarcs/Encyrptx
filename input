If multiple cryptographic processors are in use by the sender, then
the sender MUST ensure that, for a particular key, each value of the
nonce_explicit used with that key is distinct.  In this case, each
encryption processor SHOULD include, in the nonce_explicit, a fixed
value that is distinct for each processor.  The recommended format is
nonce_explicit = FixedDistinct || Variable
